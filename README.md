# Bryce-Bio-Readme 
//Brief intro about me, Hello, I’m Bryce Njoku, a High school student currently participating in a virtual-tech program where I learn amazing tech skills that I could take with me in the real world. I am looking forward to connecting with mentors who can help guide my path in the tech industry. I also enjoy coding for fun and design new websites and look forward to having an amazing career in the tech industry. This journey has taught me how to embrace problem-solving, ask better questions, and approach mistakes as stepping stones. Coding, I’ve learned, isn’t just about writing commands—it’s about creating, exploring, and thinking in entirely new ways. My goal is to become a software engineer and design my own game.
